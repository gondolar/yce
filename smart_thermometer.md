# Smart Thermometer Pitch

Every year, companies and supply chains handling perishables lose millions due to refrigeration issues. But beyond system failures, they also bleed money from uncontrolled or inefficient refrigeration. 

Our solution is designed to stop or minimize those losses.

## Introducing the Smart Thermometer

An inexpensive-to-acquire, high-value solution: the Smart Thermometer. It comes with no upfront costs—we install it for free, and you only pay when it starts saving you money.

That’s how much we trust its value. Once deployed, the units pay for themselves.

## More Than Just a Thermometer

This is not just a thermometer. It’s a cost analysis platform and a contingency strategy. Along with the deployed thermometers, you get access to an online service that tells you everything you need to know about your refrigeration processes:

- Identify unnecessary energy costs from excessive cooling
- Receive early warnings about equipment failures
- Optimize maintenance schedules

## Honest Value

As companies and food/drug chains own many refrigeration units, our small company doesn't have the means to cover deployment costs in advance—especially after our investment in R&D to create a real solution.

But we've designed our production process to keep costs as low as possible. Our main expenses are components and supporting our people.

When we ask for support at this stage, it's not to make a profit—it’s simply to stay afloat until your savings begin. Once they do, the system pays for itself.

## Strategic Opportunity

By supporting us now, you secure exclusivity—and an advantage over competitors who wait. This is your opportunity to lead, save money, and shape the future of refrigeration monitoring.
